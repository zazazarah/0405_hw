		<p class="white-text sub-text"><img class="article-image" src="Betty-White.jpg" />The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorc&eacute;e) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) and divorc&eacute;e Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy&rsquo;s mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>

And if you threw a party, invited everyone you knew, you would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say, Thank You For Being a&nbsp;Friend!</p>
